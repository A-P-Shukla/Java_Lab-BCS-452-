## List of Experiments

This repository contains the Java programs for the following 10 experiments:

1.  **Hello World & Escape Sequences:** A simple program using Eclipse IDE to display "Hello, Java World from Eclipse!" on the console and demonstrate the use of major escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, `\\`, `\"`, `\'`, `\r`).

2.  **Command-Line Arguments:** A program that accepts two integer numbers as command-line arguments, calculates their sum, and displays the result, with proper parsing and error handling.

3.  **Classes and Objects:** A program to create two classes, `Student` (with `name` and `rollNo`) and `Rectangle` (with `length` and `width`), and their respective methods to display details and calculate area.

4.  **Inheritance and Polymorphism:** A program demonstrating single-level inheritance (`Dog` inherits from `Animal`), method overriding (runtime polymorphism), and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).

5.  **Exception Handling and Multithreading:** A program that demonstrates exception handling for arithmetic exceptions using `try-catch-finally` blocks and implements multithreading by running two concurrent threads.

6.  **Packages:** A program that creates a user-defined package named `studentinfo`, containing a `Student` class, and demonstrates how to import and use it in another class.

7.  **File I/O Streams:** A program that uses Java I/O streams (`FileReader` and `FileWriter`) to read data from one text file and write it to another, including proper exception handling.

8.  **Spring Framework (Annotation-based Configuration):** A simple Spring-based application demonstrating dependency injection using annotation-based configuration with `@Component` and `@Autowired`.

9.  **RESTful Web Service with Spring Boot:** A RESTful web service developed using Spring Boot that handles HTTP GET requests and returns a simple JSON message, using annotations like `@RestController` and `@GetMapping`.

10. **Frontend Web App with Spring Boot & Thymeleaf:** A basic frontend web application built with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf that takes user input via a form and displays the submitted data back to the user, demonstrating the integration of backend logic with frontend rendering.
